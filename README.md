This is a challenge on front end mentor site to build a Rock , Paper , scissors game...
It was nice being able to put your coding skills together to bring out something worthwhile.
And at the same time learn new stuff..
I do hope u enjoy the game... 
looking forward to candid review from you... 
there are always room for improvement
